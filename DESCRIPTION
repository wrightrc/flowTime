Description: This package was developed for analysis of both dynamic
        and steady state experiments examining the function of gene
        regulatory networks in yeast (strain W303) expressing
        fluorescent reporter proteins using a BD Accuri C6 and SORP
        cytometers. However, the functions are for the most part
        general and may be adapted for analysis of other organisms
        using other flow cytometers. Functions in this package
        facilitate the annotation of flow cytometry data with
        experimental metadata, as is requisite for dissemination and
        general ease-of-use. Functions for creating, saving and loading
        gate sets are also included. In the past, we have typically
        generated summary statistics for each flowset for each
        timepoint and then annotated and analyzed these summary
        statistics. This method loses a great deal of the power that
        comes from the large amounts of individual cell data generated
        in flow cytometry, by essentially collapsing this data into a
        bulk measurement after subsetting. In addition to these summary
        functions, this package also contains functions to facilitate
        annotation and analysis of steady-state or time-lapse data
        utilizing all of the data collected from the thousands of
        individual cells in each sample.
